//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- new formatting guide!!
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- when sorting layers need to throw away elements that are not visible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- compile sfml or use different window library (glfw? qt? (probs not though))

- better obj loading
{
    - can be done backwards ( faces first ) for less lookups?
}

- shadows are slow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- evil
{
    - should use a different mesh for visibility checking, just a box?
}

- evil distortion
{
    - find evil position in pixels
    - black noise which has higher alpha the closer to him it is, plus random
        component
    - should it use depth testing?
}

- flare lighting ( and shadows?? )


- rooms
{
    -intro
    {
        - doorway?
        - text?
    }

    - facility?
    {
        - metal walls ( could be stone )
        - blood on walls
        {
            - nice for specular map??
        }
        - evil casts black light?
    }
    - cellar
    {
        - wooden walls ( could be stone )
        - almost pitch black
        - have shitty light source, i.e. rechargeable flare
    }
    - house
    {
        - camera distorts closer to evil
        - evil moves faster??
    }
    - tunnels
    {
        - very dark but player doesn't have light source
        - music plays and distorts closer to evil
        - evil glitches
    }
    - outdoor
    {
        - evil drops from the sky
        - has black noise style distortion
        - ground distorts??
        - super intense dissonant music
    }

    - outro
    {
        - white light
        - piano music
        - something happens?
    }
}


++++
I am evil
I am eternal
I do not sleep
I do not rest

I am that which is unkillable
that which is undefeatable
that which strikes fear into the hearts of men

So if I was you, I'd start running


Let us find out how this ends

| NEXT VERSION |
\++++++++++++++/

- camera does need to apply every time, just calculate what's changed

- renderer
{
    - renderlists can be pulled in to renderer
    - colour mapping can be done once before rendering
    - maybe only render one colour pass with everything in it
    {
        - this means we can do proper colour picking with obstructions??
        - but affects using different renderables for visibility checking
    }
}

- shadows
{
    - smooth shadows
}

- normal maps

- anti-aliasing?

- rigging
