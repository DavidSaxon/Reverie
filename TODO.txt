- extend skirting and other geo for shadows

- Level generation
{
    - Need to plan out how the grid works

    - Factory to make blocks
    - Way to control blocks
    {
        - figure out what needs to be generated
        - hide what's behind the player
    }
}

- Vsync off by default??

- player controls
{
    - test portal and outlast

    - animation for walk

    - accelerated walk?

    - diagonal walk

    - multiple keys ( left then right then left )

    - clamp look

    - accelerated look?
}

- spot light shadows? or hidden dir light, works for point light too then (YES)


- player

    - better movement
    {
        - fix release when holding two keys
        - diagonal movement
        - run
        - animation (bobbing)
    }
}

- overlay
{
    - investigate shadows on overlay etc..
}

- depth of feild?

- motion blur
{
    - store previous position and interpolate
    - start with camera
    - then do for renderables
    - could maybe do motion blurs at lower res
    {
        - hard since we need to switch texture size all the time
        - or have copies of motion blur textures?
    }
}
